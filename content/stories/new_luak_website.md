For 4 years now, I have been promising to make a new website for LUAK. Most of you probably thougt it woud never happen. But the future is now! Take your agendas and mark the date, because this day is going down in the LUAK history books.

## What's new?

The biggest change is that from now on memberships will be handled through this website. This means that **you can now register and pay your membership fee online**. This will make it easier for us to keep track of who is a member and who is not. It will also make it easier for you to pay your membership fee.

## What's next?

There is still a bunch of features to be improved, and still some data to be ported from the old website to the new one. For now the stories are gone, but they will be back soon.

## Can I help?

Of course! If you have any suggestions or if you want to help with the development of the website, please contact me (Cedric) on whatsapp.

Lots of LUAK Love xx,
Cedric ðŸ˜—
