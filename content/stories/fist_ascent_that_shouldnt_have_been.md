Summer meet 2021 – location La Bérarde

## Cascade d’en bas

The first climbing day was an absolute joy. 3 climbing parties went to cascade d’en bas for climbing next to the B-E-A-Utifull waterfall on perfect crispy granite. Febe and Kobe (who took his big camera) climbed a 6a-max route on the right side. I climbed with Cedric a stunning sustained route graded 6b on the left flank. (Even though not often travelled ) the route felt like an absolute classic.

Amazing 3D-climbing on perfect granite. No-hands-kneebars, hand and footjams, heelhooks – a full range of movements in a crazy (AND VERY EXPOSED) atmosphere. Since I brought my camera, and Kobe was photographing from the other side this gave some amazing pictures.

## Some alpine plans

Needless to say – the psych was VERY high in the camping lot that evening. And you know how that goes. One party is planning a crazy trad outing of valley to summit to valley of 16h guidebook time. These type of plans are even more contagious than the indian-variety of corona. Before you can blink, everyone is making rad/ambitious plans for the day after.

Earlier I had promised Kobe we would go on an alpine style trad outing together. Our aim was going to do the approach towards cirque du soreiller that same evening (bivouac style). The day after we would try to climb the pillier du chèze (on tête du rouget) and sleep a second night before doing another climb on aiguille dibona or aiguille orientale du soreiller. We packed – took photo’s of the guidebook - had dinner and left for the 2-3 hours approach.

::

Where early in the evening there was some rainclouds, now the sky cleared up entirely and we enjoyed the hike in stunning evening light. By the time the last sunrays were hitting the mountains we arrived in cirque du soreiller. We get the name (and reputation now) – half a circle of crazy, big alpine walls are waiting for us, with the inspiring Dibona as guardian.

We looked at pictures of the guidebook to scout the approach and route for the next day. Some years ago someone pointed me the peak of ‘Le Rouget’ from the camping. Now we were looking at its west face – through which we had to climb. We find a triangular feature the looks a lot like the start of our route, no snow on the approach like in the guidebook, and the color is a bit different. But hey – you never know from which angle this picture is taken.

Route located – approach path looks obvious – and even better some grassy meadows lie beneath the face, perfect for pretty decent bivvy spot.

We have dinner – pack our bag and set the alarm for next morning – and read through the guidebook a couple more times. Next morning we are so psyched that we wake up, have breakfast, break up tent and sleeping bags – all inside 35 minute. Let the adventure start!

After the first 15 minutes it turn out the approach ‘path’ we took isn’t really what we expected. Soon we get in some steeper terrain of grassy gully’s with loose rock. At this point I decide its better to rope up and place some protection once in a while – still cruising on approach shoes. This goes on for a while – some sections easy – others never really hard, but sketchy due to rotten rock.

By this time we figured we took the wrong approach, the official approach leaves from the hut and traverses higher up. But as long as we don’t get blocked and head in the direction of where the gendarme mark the start of the southwest ridge – everything should be fine.

The terrain start’s to get even steeper now. A point where the decision to put on climbing shoes is easily taken. We haven’t seen any bolts or pithon, but since we prepared for a trad route we have an entire rack. Most of the time we move in simul-style to be fast. When harder ‘pitches’ come up – we build an anchor out of anything we can find and pitch the bastards.

Now each of us climbs a pitch we rather would not have done – no easy terrain with barely any good protection – and still shitty rotten rock. We communicate this is crossing the border of risk we want to take – and that when we find our route we will take the abseil escape via the south ridge to get down. However everytime we cross a ridge expecting to find a familiar view we don’t.

At last we find a good grassy ledge and the prospect of WAY better rock. But not a sign of where our route should be. I notice that for the first time that day I have some phone reception and try to find our location. Somehow – we traversed way to far to the right, bringing us in the SW-face. But further on – the south face should have some bolted climbs where we might find some abseils – there even seems to be a path leading there. Weird thing is that according to my phone we are still at 2700 – 600’ish meters below the summit.

The path on the grassy ledge seems to continue in an easy way and brings us again higher up. At some point we even start to think that we might be able to reach the summit via the back side – so we could take the normal descend. Hopes get up – we start to have fun again – I even joke that it would have sucked to become part of the luak heli-rescue-statistics.

UNTIL: KLANGBADABANGBANGKLINGDINGBING (the sound of our hopes shattering)

The next plateau brings bad news – all around us are steep fields of loose rubble and after that, what looks like very hard ridges leading to a summit. NO WAY we will cross those.

However – by now we climbed so far through unknown loose terrain and full trad. Making retracing our steps impossible. We shortly debate abseiling via the south side, but, we don’t know where we would go, how far we would have to go, and if we would pass routes… Surprisingly easy decision – we call for rescue.

This is a very weird position, we are both 100% fine, its around 1pm, weather is perfect and are in a perfectly safe position. But wherever we would go from there, brings us a lot of uncertainty unless the big chance of doing very sketchy dangerous things. I check our position again – still on the SW face, and weirdly --- still not that much above 2700m…

I find the spot with the best phone signal and call the La Bérarde mountain rescue, explain everything in my best French, by the time they tell me to contact 112.

I do this, and have to explain everything all over again (TWICE) (and hey would you think the people taking up the phone for the international alarm number speak English). Have to repeat 15 times that we are not harmed and in a safe position, and finally they tell that in an hour a helicopter will be sent.

15 minutes of sunbathing (and questioning our life decisions later) – a helicopter shows up on the horizon – we form the Y (meaning Yes I want rescue) with our arms – and somehow the helicopter flies by the location we are standing.

15 minutes of flying around later they spot us and pick us up. The flight last about 2 minutes, and we get kicked out at the refuge du soreiller (with a crowd ---- spoken about a walk of shame). We get to our senses for about 1 min and look up to : the exact picture in our guidebook. On the wrong mountain.

We didn’t just fuck up our approach – not finding our route. We climbed THE WRONG MOUNTAIN.

A lot of things start to get clear now. How could we have been at 2700m if our climb starts about 200m higher… By not hiking entirely up to the hut (planning to bivouac) we didn’t go far enough to be able to see the right climb – so we climbed one that looked pretty similar.

During the descent to our tent I don’t say a word for about an hour. I am so angry with myself for getting in this position, were both me and Kobe crossed the borders on risk we wanted to take. At the tent (after a good lunch) my mood gets a bit better – and we can discuss over things. - We were a bit underprepared, planning everything just the evening before. - Because of wrong information I had about the position of le Rouget, we never really debated if we were actually looking at the right mountain. But on the positive side: - We were a bit unlucky to get in a very shitty position. Given this we did everything as safe and controlled as we possibly could have done. Starting from our approach, each of our decisions we made (roping up, climbing shoes, open communication, discussing descending and even calling the helicopter) was perfect. - And most of all we made it back SAFE, and without being harmed.

Lessons to be learned from this experience: - No matter how experienced you are: ALWAYS be well prepared. Any climb in alpine terrain is serious – and the margins for errors are small. - ALWAYS take a charged phone, headlamp and protection against weather (EACH). o Without my phone we could have gotten ourself in a lot of trouble. o Mistakes happen to everyone and If bad weather or night would had arrived (and we weren’t able to contact rescue) we were prepared for being able to descend in or shiver through the night

Overall – yet another great story to be told, about a first ascent that shouldn’t have been and probably will never be repeated.
