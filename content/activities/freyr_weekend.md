Freyyyyyyyyyr, the epicenter of the universe!!! During this weekend we climb a lot🧗, sleep on the bivouac🏕️, make a campfire🔥 and have a very good time.

For this activity **lead climbing experience** is recommended and you need to be **member of KBF** or another European climbing federation. For the transport we have the KUL vans (only for people with a sportscard) and we'll arrange a carpool. Freyr is also accessible with the train to Anseremme and 40min hike along the Maas river.

We will stay overnight on the bivouac spot in Freyr. A tent and sleeping gear (sufficiently warm!!!) are required. Let us know if you still need something. Also bring 2 euro cash to pay for the bivouac (it's a small fee to help pay for the accommodations there).

Bring food for the weekend (there is a store in Anseremme, but we lose less time if everyone brings their food). In the evening usually we eat fries at the Colébi, close to the bivouac.
