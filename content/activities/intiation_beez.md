For the first initiation on Saturday 5 October we are going to Beez!

On the initiation the experienced members of LUAK will hang topropes, then we give a quick demo of how to do everything safely (very similar to indoor toproping) and then we climb for the rest of the day. This way you don't need any experience to join. LUAK fixes a group insurance for those who don't have one, this is free.

We will be going with a KUL van (only for KUL students with a sportcard), and possibly some other cars. The area is also accessible by taking the train to marche-les-dammes plus a 30min walk to the rocks. The people who will go by VAN/car meet at the spuye at 8h30.
We can't predict at what time we will be back in Leuven, it depends on the energy of everyone and the weather, but usually we are back around 7-8pm.
